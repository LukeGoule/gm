Simple Garry's Mod cheat base. Contains a basic SDK for lua mods and game engine mods. Written in C++ despite what Github thinks.

## Compiling
- Install visual studio 2019+
- Press the build button on visual studio.
- inject with your favourite injector.

## Notes
- Please don't paste this into some godawful p2c, I made it as a little bit of fun over summer 2020 and as a reverse engineering exercise. It doesn't need to be molested into becoming a part of your bad business. Thank you.
- I will *not* under *any* circumstance release a version where BASS is included. That would probably be breaking a lot of laws. If you want that version then google "virtuosity.pro source leak" since that was the project it came from (was a dev on that project haha).
